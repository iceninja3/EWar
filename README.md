# EWar (current dev thoughts)!

## Frontend
Where to get card designs?
Card goes onto the pile animation? Should it just appear there?
How does the pile look structured? Should users be able to look a few cards down from the card on top?
Burn Pile?

When does the deck reset?
Make a certain number of other players based on user settings
Face cards requiring cards to be placed down by one user
Keyboard input
Spacebar to place a card down
Different key to slap

## Backend
Make a user account with password
Preferred combos to play in game
How many players to play with (other players are just computers playing a card down they won't actually slap)
